              The COVID-19 vaccine will reduce the risk of being suffering from the new type of Coronavirus disease as known as COVID-19. 

Please be aware that the vaccine is not completely effective like all other medicines. It can take a few weeks for your body to 
              build up protection from the vaccine. There is always a chance to get infected by Coronavirus even with the vaccine; however, 
              the vaccine lessens the severity of any infection. Two doses will reduce the chance of being seriously ill and reduce the 
              risk of death due to Coronavirus.

You still need to follow the health instructions in your workplace and in public areas, such as wearing a mask and keeping the 
              distance from others after you received the COVID-19 vaccine.

The vaccine has some side effects as the other vaccines/medicines, but not everyone gets them. 

The most likely side effects that you may experience from the vaccine
